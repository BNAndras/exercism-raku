# Accumulate

Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an
operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new
collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of
the input collection.

Given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the operation:

- square a number (`x => x * x`)

Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:

- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.

Lisp specific: it's perfectly fine to use `MAPCAR` or the equivalent,
as this is idiomatic Lisp, not a library function.

## Resources

Remember to check out the Perl 6 [documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/) and
[resources](https://perl6.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test script included with the exercise; a file with the extension
`.t`. You can run the test script for the exercise by executing the command
`prove . --exec=perl6` in the exercise directory. You can also add the `-v` flag
e.g. `prove . --exec=perl6 -v` to display all tests, including any optional
tests marked as 'TODO'.
