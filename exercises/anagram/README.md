# Anagram

Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Resources

examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test script included with the exercise; a file with the extension
`.t`. You can run the test script for the exercise by executing the command
`prove . --exec=perl6` in the exercise directory. You can also add the `-v` flag
e.g. `prove . --exec=perl6 -v` to display all tests, including any optional
tests marked as 'TODO'.
