exercise_comment: The name of this exercise.
module_comment: "%*ENV<EXERCISM> is for tests not directly for the exercise, don't worry about these :)"
version_comment: The version we will be matching against the exercise.
lib_comment: Look for the module inside the same directory as this test file.
plan_comment: This is how many tests we expect to run.
use_test_comment: Check that the module can be use-d.
version_test_comment: "If the exercise is updated, we want to make sure other people testing\nyour code don't think you've made a mistake if things have changed!"
imports_comment: Import '&hello' from 'HelloWorld'
cdata_test_comment: Ignore this for your exercise! Tells Exercism folks when exercise cases become out of date.
done_testing_comment: There are no more tests after this :)
INIT_comment: "'INIT' is a phaser, it makes sure that the test data is available before everything else\nstarts running (otherwise we'd have to shove the test data into the middle of the file!)"

    This is a 'stub' file. It's a little start on your solution.
    It is not a complete solution though; you will have to write some code.
  
    The ':ver<>' adverb defines the version of a module or class.
    The version is checked in the test suite to ensure the exercise
    and test suite line up. If the test is updated, it will indicate
    to others who test your code that some tests may no longer pass.

  sub hello is export {
    'Hello, World!'

stub: |
  sub hello is export {
    # Write your solution to pass the test suite here.
    # Be sure to remove all stock comments once you are done!
  }
