# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

```text
"One for X, one for me."
```

When X is a name or "you".

If the given name is "Alice", the result should be "One for Alice, one for me."
If no name is given, the result should be "One for you, one for me."

## Test-Driven Development

As programmers mature, they eventually want to test their code.

Here at Exercism we simulate [Test-Driven
Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD), where
you write your tests before writing any functionality. The simulation comes in
the form of a pre-written test suite, which will signal that you have solved
the problem.

It will also provide you with a safety net to explore other solutions without
breaking the functionality.

### A typical TDD workflow on Exercism:

1. Run the test file and pick one test that's failing.
2. Write some code to fix the test you picked.
3. Re-run the tests to confirm the test is now passing.
4. Repeat from step 1.
5. Submit your solution (`exercism submit /path/to/file`)

## Instructions

Submissions are encouraged to be general, within reason. Having said that, it's
also important not to over-engineer a solution.

It's important to remember that the goal is to make code as expressive and
readable as we can.

## Resources

Remember to check out the Perl 6 [documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/) and
[resources](https://perl6.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test suite and module included with the exercise.
The test suite (a file with the extension `.t`) will attempt to run routines
from the module (a file with the extension `.pm6`).
Add/modify routines in the module so that the tests will pass! You can view the
test data by executing the command `perl6 --doc *.t` (\* being the name of the
test suite), and run the test suite for the exercise by executing the command
`prove . --exec=perl6` in the exercise directory.
You can also add the `-v` flag e.g. `prove . --exec=perl6 -v` to display all
tests, including any optional tests marked as 'TODO'.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
