From the [Perl 6 Introduction](http://perl6intro.com/#_what_is_perl_6):

Perl 6 is a high-level, general-purpose, gradually typed language. Perl 6 is multi-paradigmatic. It supports Procedural, Object Oriented, and Functional programming.

Perl 6 motto:
*  TMTOWTDI (Pronounced Tim Toady): There is more than one way to do it.
*  Easy things should stay easy, hard things should get easier, and impossible things should get hard.
