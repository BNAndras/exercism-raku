### Perl 6 icon
The Perl 6 "Camelia" logo is owned by Larry Wall and is released under version 2.0 of the Artistic License. We are using it to identify the Perl 6 language itself, not any part of Exercism, which we believe to be admissible under fair use. The version of the logo that we are using is a pink, black and white adaptation of the logo found on <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6>.
