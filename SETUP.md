## Resources

Remember to check out the Perl 6 [documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/) and [resources](https://perl6.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test script included with the exercise; a file with the extension `.t`. Run the test script for the exercise by running `perl6` with the test file as an argument. e.g. `perl6 example.t`.
