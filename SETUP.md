## Resources

Remember to check out the Perl 6 [documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/) and
[resources](https://perl6.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test script included with the exercise; a file with the extension
`.t`. You can run the test script for the exercise with the following commands:

  - `prove -ve perl6 .`
  - `perl6 example.t` (replacing `example.t` with the included `.t` file.)
